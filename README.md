# GMM_appendix

Once you've cloned the Github repository on your own session, you can simply reproduce the pdf outputs by executing one of these two instructions, at the root of the folder:

- Clicking on button `Knit to rjournal_article`, or with the R command line`rmarkdown::render` with file *chassagnol-becht-nuel-benchmark-of-Gaussian-mixtures-appendix-RJ-template.Rmd*. Note that this command generates both HTML and pdf outputs with the R Journal template, along with the R scripts inserted as chunks in the Rmd file.

- Clicking on button `Knit to pdf_book`, or with the R command line `rmarkdown::render` with file *chassagnol-becht-nuel-benchmark-of-Gaussian-mixtures-appendix.Rmd*. Note that the correspondign pdf output is the raw `bookdown::pdf_book` format, setting `highlight` to `tango`.
